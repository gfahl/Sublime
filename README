My configuration files, plugins etc. for Sublime Text 2.

Notes:
It seems platform-specific settings in the User package folder are not possible at the moment.
"User/Preferences (OSX).sublime-settings" etc. would have been nice but doesn't work.
Therefore, I put my font settings in the Default folder:
Default/Preferences (OSX).sublime-settings
	"font_face": "Inconsolata",
	"font_size": 14.0,
Default/Preferences (Windows).sublime-settings
	"font_face": "Consolas",
	"font_size": 10
